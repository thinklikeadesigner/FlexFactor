		Welcome to FlexFactor, your ultimate tool for estimating muscle mass and fat gain during a bulk.
		Our algorithm is based on research by <a

			rel="noreferrer">Stijn van Willigen</a
		> and Gilbert Forbes to help you calculate your p-ratio and give you an estimate of your potential
		gains.

	<p class="my-4">
		Please note that while our app is designed to be a powerful tool, it's important to remember

		stress levels, rest, supplementation, and other lifestyle factors can all have an impact on your
		gains.

		But don't let that discourage you! With accurate input data such as body fat percentage, weight,
		and one rep max, you can use FlexFactor to help guide your diet and training regime. And with
		the help of a qualified fitness professional or medical practitioner, you can maximize your
		gains and achieve your fitness goals.

		So, whether you're a seasoned gym-goer or just starting out, FlexFactor is the app you need to
		take your gains to the next level. Try it out now and see what you might be capable of!
